The plugin adds Custom Content Types to Arne Bachold's Google XML Sitemaps plugin.

== Description ==

This plugin is an extension of Arne Brachold's Google XML Sitemaps plugin. It adds all your custom content types that the original plugin does not currently do. With luck, this plugin will be made redundant when Google XML Sitemaps is next updated.

This plugin depends on Google XML Sitemaps to work, which you need to install first.  You can get that plugin from here: http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/google-sitemap-generator/

This plugin will honour postID and category exclusions and won't list password protected posts.


== Installation ==

1. Make sure Google XML Sitemaps is installed and activated
1. Upload this plugin into your wp-content/plugins directory
1. Activate the plugin at the plugin administration page
